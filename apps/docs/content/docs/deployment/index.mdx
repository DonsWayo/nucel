## Deployment Workflow

<Callout type="info">
  Our deployment process is designed to be simple yet powerful, giving you full control while abstracting complexity.
</Callout>

### 1. **Build Phase**
Your application is built using framework-specific adapters that optimize for serverless deployment:
- Tree-shaking and minification
- Static asset optimization
- Lambda function bundling
- Dependency resolution

### 2. **Infrastructure Phase**
Pulumi provisions AWS resources automatically:
- Lambda functions for SSR
- S3 buckets for static assets
- CloudFront distribution for CDN
- DynamoDB tables for caching (Next.js)
- IAM roles and policies

### 3. **Deployment Phase**
Your application is deployed globally:
- Upload static assets to S3
- Deploy Lambda functions
- Configure CloudFront behaviors
- Set up custom domains
- Enable monitoring

## Key Features

### üöÄ **Zero-Downtime Deployments**
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automatic rollback on failures
- Health checks before switching
- CloudFront cache invalidation

### üåç **Global Distribution**
- 450+ CloudFront edge locations
- Automatic geo-routing
- Regional failover support
- Optimized for all continents

### üìä **Comprehensive Monitoring**
- Real-time CloudWatch metrics
- Custom dashboards
- Error tracking and alerts
- Performance analytics

### üîí **Enterprise Security**
- AWS WAF integration
- DDoS protection with Shield
- SSL/TLS encryption
- IAM role-based access

## Deployment Strategies

### Development Deployment
Quick iterations with instant feedback:
```bash
nucel deploy --stack dev
```
- Fast deployments
- Verbose logging
- Debug information
- Cost-optimized settings

### Staging Deployment
Production-like environment for testing:
```bash
nucel deploy --stack staging
```
- Production configuration
- Performance testing
- Integration testing
- Security validation

### Production Deployment
Optimized for reliability and performance:
```bash
nucel deploy --stack production --preview
nucel deploy --stack production
```
- High availability
- Auto-scaling
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive monitoring

## Environment Management

### Stack-Based Deployments
Manage multiple environments independently:

| Stack | Purpose | Configuration |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **dev** | Development | Minimal resources, debug enabled |
| **staging** | Testing | Production-like, lower capacity |
| **production** | Live traffic | Full capacity, monitoring enabled |
| **preview** | PR previews | Temporary, auto-cleanup |

### Environment Variables
Secure configuration management:
- `.env.development` - Local development
- `.env.staging` - Staging environment
- `.env.production` - Production secrets
- Pulumi secrets for sensitive data

## Cost Management

### Typical Costs by Traffic

| Monthly Traffic | Estimated Cost | Configuration |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| < 100K requests | $10-20 | Basic setup |
| 100K-1M requests | $20-50 | Standard setup |
| 1M-10M requests | $50-200 | Optimized setup |
| 10M+ requests | $200+ | Enterprise setup |

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. Use ARM64 Lambda architecture (20% cheaper)
2. Enable CloudFront caching
3. Optimize image delivery
4. Set appropriate Lambda memory
5. Use S3 lifecycle policies

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations completed
- [ ] SSL certificates validated
- [ ] Health checks implemented
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Backup strategy defined
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
- [ ] Performance benchmarked
- [ ] Security scan passed

## Advanced Topics

### Multi-Region Deployment
Deploy globally for maximum availability:
```typescript
const regions = ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1', 'ap-southeast-1'];
```

### Blue-Green Deployment
Zero-downtime updates with instant rollback:
```typescript
{
  strategy: 'blue-green',
  healthCheck: '/api/health',
  rollbackOnFailure: true
}
```

### Canary Releases
Gradual rollout to minimize risk:
```typescript
{
  canary: {
    percentage: 10,
    duration: '30m',
    metrics: ['error-rate', 'latency']
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Deployments

Common deployment issues and solutions:

### Build Failures
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Review build logs for errors

### Permission Errors
- Ensure AWS credentials are configured
- Check IAM role permissions
- Verify Pulumi access

### Runtime Errors
- Check CloudWatch logs
- Verify environment variables
- Test Lambda function locally
