## The Problem

Deploying modern web applications to AWS involves complex infrastructure decisions:

- **Infrastructure Complexity**: Setting up Lambda, CloudFront, S3, and networking requires deep AWS knowledge
- **Framework Compatibility**: Each framework (Next.js, SvelteKit, React Router) has unique deployment requirements
- **Configuration Management**: Managing environment variables, secrets, and multi-environment deployments
- **Cost Optimization**: Avoiding unnecessary AWS services while maintaining performance
- **Developer Experience**: Long deployment times and complex debugging processes

## The Solution

Nucel abstracts AWS infrastructure complexity while maintaining full control and transparency. It provides:

### Zero-Configuration Deployments
Deploy with a single command. Nucel automatically detects your framework and configures optimal infrastructure.

### Pulumi Automation API
No Pulumi CLI required. Everything runs through inline programs with the Nucel CLI, making deployments portable and CI/CD friendly.

### Framework-Native Support
Purpose-built adapters for each framework ensure all features work as expected:
- **Next.js**: ISR, App Router, streaming SSR
- **SvelteKit**: Form actions, SSR, adapters
- **React Router v7**: Full Remix features merged into v7

## How Nucel Works

<Steps>
<Step>

### Detection

Nucel analyzes your project structure to identify:
- Framework type (Next.js, SvelteKit, React Router)
- Build configuration
- Environment variables
- Public assets

</Step>
<Step>

### Build

Executes framework-specific build commands:
- Runs your build script
- Optimizes outputs for AWS Lambda
- Separates static and dynamic assets
- Prepares server handlers

</Step>
<Step>

### Infrastructure

Creates AWS resources using Pulumi:
- Lambda functions for SSR
- S3 buckets for static assets
- CloudFront for global CDN
- IAM roles with minimal permissions

</Step>
<Step>

### Deployment

Uploads and configures your application:
- Deploys Lambda function code
- Syncs static assets to S3
- Invalidates CDN cache
- Returns your CloudFront URL

</Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture Overview

Nucel provisions a modern, serverless architecture on AWS:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Browser   │────▶│  CloudFront  │────▶│   Lambda    │
└─────────────┘     │     (CDN)    │     │   (SSR)     │
                    └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                            │                     │
                            ▼                     ▼
                    ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
                    │  S3 Bucket   │     │  DynamoDB   │
                    │   (Static)   │     │  (Session)  │
                    └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

### Components

**CloudFront Distribution**
- Global edge locations for low latency
- Intelligent caching for static assets
- Custom error pages
- Security headers

**Lambda Function**
- Server-side rendering
- API routes
- Dynamic content generation
- Auto-scaling based on traffic

**S3 Bucket**
- Static asset storage
- Direct CloudFront integration
- Versioned deployments
- Private bucket with CDN-only access

**IAM Roles**
- Least privilege principle
- Service-specific permissions
- Cross-service authentication
- Secure secret access

## Philosophy

### Open Source First
Nucel is fully open source. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary services, just clean infrastructure code you can understand and modify.

### Pay for What You Use
No subscriptions or seat licenses. You only pay for AWS resources you consume, typically under $5/month for moderate traffic.

### Framework Agnostic
While optimized for Next.js, SvelteKit, and React Router, Nucel's architecture supports any Node.js application.

### Developer Experience
Fast deployments, clear error messages, and predictable behavior. Nucel respects your time and mental energy.

### Not Ideal For

- **WebSocket Applications**: Use AWS API Gateway WebSockets instead
- **Long-Running Tasks**: Consider Step Functions or ECS
- **Large File Processing**: Use S3 and Lambda separately
- **Real-time Gaming**: Requires persistent connections
- **Video Streaming**: Use AWS MediaServices

## Security

Nucel follows AWS security best practices:

<Callout type="info">
All infrastructure is created in your AWS account. You maintain full control and visibility.
</Callout>

- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for each service
- **Private S3**: Buckets are private with CloudFront OAI
- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic encrypted in transit
- **No Public IPs**: Lambda functions run in private subnets
- **Secrets Management**: Integration with AWS Secrets Manager
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Full audit trail of function execution

## Cost Analysis

Typical monthly costs for a production application:

| Traffic | Requests | Data Transfer | Storage | Total |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Low | 100K | 10 GB | 1 GB | ~$2 |
| Medium | 1M | 100 GB | 10 GB | ~$15 |
| High | 10M | 1 TB | 100 GB | ~$120 |

<Callout>
Most applications fall into the "Low" category. Nucel's architecture is designed to minimize costs while maintaining performance.
</Callout>
